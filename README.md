# Research_Tools
Container for functions and equations

## Description
Currently each project has a sub-folder containing the code in this package.  The intention will be to downselect only the relavent tools once those packages are no longer being changed.  Until then, the tools package can be updated here and changes are pushed locally to the other repositories by running the `init_util.py` script.

## Contents
- `utils`: Contains project management scripts unrelated to the library
    - `init_util.py`: Create str for __init__ files or push updates to all packages
    - `gen_package_list.py`: create an env.yml
- `equations`: Contains scripts w/ basic equations which can be called an manipulated
- `functions`: Contains useful operational functions to interface with data or os
